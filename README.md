# NumericalMath library

The goal of this library is to provide user with bunch of mathematical tools which he could use both with ease and efficiency of C programming language. The library main targets are microcontrollers based on ARM architecture, but the library will be also available for x86 desktop computers.

## Contents of the library
1. Matrix library (single and double precision)
   1. Matrix addition 
   2. Matrix subtraction
   3. Matrix multiplication
   4. Matrix LU decomposition with partial pivoting
   5. Matrix inversion
